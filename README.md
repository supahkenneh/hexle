# Hexle

This project was created for fun using purely React. This game was inspired by Wordle - a popular word game by The New York Times. 

## Overview
In this game, a color is shown to you daily and you have 6 chances to guess the hexcode for the color displayed.

## Instructions
1. Go to: https://www.supahkenneh.com/hexle
2. Observe the color given to you on the screen.
3. Using your mouse - select six characters and click 'Enter' to start guessing the hexcode for the color shown. 
- A green box means the character is in the right position
- A yellow box means the character exists in the hexcode but is in the wrong position
- A gray box means the character does not exist in the hexcode
